            <p>Hello everyone! This website is here to introduce myself and what I do. Here you will be able to see details
                about my life, my work, my resume, and also the information required to be able to contact me.

            <h3>My RoadtoHire Journey</h3>
            <p>This journey for me has been a bit different than most of the other participants. It it is actually my    second time around- but the first for tech. Back in 2016 I went through the first ever sales cohort for RoadtoHire. I graduated and became a sales agent at Red Ventures. I was at Red Ventures for roughly a year and a half. I was successful as an agent, I was promoted to Senior Sales Agent within six months of starting- which is the fastest time possible. The money was great, my co-workers were awesome, and my supervisors were great as well- but I felt that I needed more than just being a Sales Agent. I left and pursued Real Estate for a few months. Real Estate didn't work out, as you can probably tell. I had some coverstations with the director of RoadtoHire, and he gave me the opportunity to apply for the tech program as I had always had a sense of curiosity towards the tech world. <br><br> There was one problem. I was nearly four weeks behind all the other applicants. They had been learning HTML and CSS and were now working on their project they had to present for the final interview process. I had two weeks to learn what they had learned and also create the project. Fast forward three weeks later- I learned what I had needed to learn through grit and determination. I created a website and earned a spot in the 5th ever RoadtoHire cohort. <br><br> My whole life I have been surrounded by tons of technology, but I knew nothing of it. I have immersed myself in the tech world for the past 6 months and I have been shocked and amazed every day since. I knew I had the curiosity for this field or work- what I didn't know was the passion I would develop. I'm continuing to learn every day and making sure it doesn't stop anytime soon.
